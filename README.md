**Computer Science Student at [TU Braunschweig, Germany](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/)**

Alongside my studies at university, I am almost always working on something on the side privately.

I am a both **technical** and **creative** person at heart and I want to pursue meaningful work. I am very much involved in the **Game Development** space because I can combine work on engine technology with artistic design.
I want the software world to become a less terrible place. I want to become the most competent person I can be and love to work on hard problems. I mainly focus on **performance** and **data-oriented design**.
Although I am mainly interested in the **practical application** of software design, I am also interested in ideas from Theoretical Computer Science if I can utilize them in the process of solving the problems I am working on.

I am constantly trying to learn as much as I can and I hope that never stops. If I think that I have some interesting projects to showcase that I am working on and I am willing to publish, I will do that here.
Please take a look at my [website](https://luca-jt.github.io/) for more.
