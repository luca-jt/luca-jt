Alongside my studies at university, I am almost always working on something on the side privately.

I am a both **technical** and **creative** person at heart and I want to pursue meaningful work. I am very much involved in the **Game Development** space as I see that domain as the best combination of both of these worlds.
My main interest is to make the software world a less terrible place. I want to become the most competent person I can be and love to work on hard problems. I focus my attention on **performance** and **data-oriented design**. I am constantly trying to learn as much as I can and I hope that never stops. If I think that I have some interesting projects to showcase that I am working on, I will do that here.

Besides that, I am also interested in ideas from the world of **Theoretical Computer Science** if I can utilize them in the process of solving the problems I am working on. Although I am mainly interested in the **practical application** of software design, from time to time these topics can be an enrichment.
